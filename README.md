# Pygame Projects
1. Tom and Jerry
  - As we see in the Tom and Jerry cartoon, Tom tries to catch Jerry in the game. Tom is falling from sky randomly to catch Jerry.
  - Jerry can only move to left and right to run away from Tom.
  - The score will be added every .5s and is displayed on the top of screen.
  - If Tom catches Jerry, the game is over and your final score will show up.
2. Ball Destroy
